# For CPLEX

Place here the folder /ibm that is installed by CPLEX (usually in /opt).
You actually only need the following substructure (makes the container lighter):
.
└───ibm
    └───ILOG
        └───CPLEX_Studio1271
            └───cplex
                ├───bin
                ├───include
                ├───lib
                └───python
				
# For Gurobi

Place here the tarball you got from the website, and modify accordingly the files:
	../utils/install_gurobi.sh 
	../utils/activate_gurobi.sh

Gurobi needs a floating license for Docker instances, (see http://www.gurobi.com/documentation/7.5/quickstart_windows/setting_up_and_using_a_flo.html#subsection:tokenserver)
Once your system administrator set it up, you will need to add your gurobi license server to ../utils/gurobi.lic.template, and rename it to gurobi.lic
